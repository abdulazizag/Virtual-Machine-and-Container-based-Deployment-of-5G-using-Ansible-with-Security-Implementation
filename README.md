## Project Overview

In this project we demonstrate two 5G deployment options. First, a container-based (Docker) implementation of 5G using Ansible and secondly a Virtual machine (VM) based implementation using Free5GC and UERANSIM. This project further implements IPsec on the Ansible deployment between the UE and UPF to protect the confidentiality of users' data.

## Project Documentation

User documentation can be found below for the two options deployed for the project
